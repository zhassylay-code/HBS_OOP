# Welcome to the Grand Hotel - we look forward to hosting you!!
Welcome to the **Grand Hotel Booking System** - a console-based Java application where users can check room availability, make bookings, and see booking details. This project was created as part of an Object-Oriented Programming course and represents a simple hotel booking system built step by step by our team.

## 🗂️This repository contains the source code for:

    🖥️ Console-based user interface (UI)
    🎛️ Controllers connecting UI and business logic
    🧠 Service layer with booking rules and price calculation
    🗄️ JDBC repositories for PostgreSQL database access
    🏨 Entity classes (Room, Booking, Guest)
    🚀 Main application entry point

## ✨ Project Features

    🏨 View available hotel rooms for selected dates
    📅 Book a room with date validation
    💰 Automatic price calculation
    🧾 Booking confirmation summary
